Downloads free/name-your-price albums from bandcamp.com

I started this because I wanted to fulfill my exact desires for downloading free albums off bandcamp, and nothing more.
Because I ended up copying some download & email code from https://github.com/yyyyyyyan/bandcamper , I threw them in the license file and at the top of `main.rs` :)
Also a progress bar is copied from https://gist.github.com/giuliano-macedo/4d11d6b3bb003dba3a1b53f43d81b30d (which has no explicit license ðŸ™ˆ)

I could've just used their project but there were a few edits I would have to make & I wanted to write some Rust, so here we are.
